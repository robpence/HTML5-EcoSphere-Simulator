# HTML5-EcoSphere-Simulator

I'm going to try and work on this a little every day. If you would like to know more about future plans you can view the rough design doc that I uploaded to this repository. 

I plan for this to be a free game and I will post it somewhere when I am done with it. 


If you would like to play it or see a demo of its incomplete state, I belive all you have to do is download the repository and then navigate to the directory with some command line tool (im using bash for windows). Then make sure you have node installed, if you do you can run it by typeing 'node app'. Then open a web browser and got to localhost:8080

Ill figure out a easier way to make it playable later.
